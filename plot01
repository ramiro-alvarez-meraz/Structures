; This batch file defines variables used in examples in
; Chapter 10, "Plotting" of _Using IDL_.

; The following are example data from a fictitious study of Pacific
; Northwest Salmon fisheries. In the examples, these data are used
; to represent fish populations sampled in the years 1967, 1970, and
; from 1975 to 1983. The vectors defined  represent the number of
; fish counted, in thousands.

thin=[4,1]
intermediate=[4,3]
thick=[4,2]

; Construct an array containing all of the SAT data.

ALLPTS = [[thin], [intermediate], [thick]]

; Construct a vector in which each element contains the year of the score.
; Create a variable containing the number of elements in the YEAR vector
; minus one.

PLANET = [1, 2]
N1 = N_ELEMENTS(PLANET) - 1
; Construct a vector of names for lines.

NAMES=['thin','intermediate', 'thick']
